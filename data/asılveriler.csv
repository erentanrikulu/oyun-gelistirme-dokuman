 Preface Preface Preface Preface     
 I have always loved the Silent Hill series; it is q uite easily one of the main contributors 
towards my extended admiration for developers. I fi rst played the game when I was fourteen 
and continuously come back to the franchise year af ter year. The reason I chose to write about 
this game is not only because Silent Hill 2 is my f avourite game of all time, but an academic 
reason to invest time in researching the game, far beyond my previous research. A lot of the 
content of this document is of course prior knowled ge of the game, but a good proportion of 
information has been discovered through this projec t, allowing me to understand its 
development with increasing complexity. Two of the main compelling objects of the 
development I have allowed to bleed into this docum ent, both of which were created before 
the original design document was realised. The firs t is the script, which I have thankfully not 
printed out as it would be far from the direction o f the assignment. The second is the main 
theme for Silent Hill 2, composed again before the original design document was conceived. I 
have in this case provided that track on a CD; if o nly to authenticate some part of the original 
document through this reverse engineering. The orig inal design document has not been 
published online, and I can only imagine that if it  was, I would need a translator to decipher the 
Japanese text. 
 I hope you enjoy this document.

 Game Concept  
Introduction  
 
 Silent Hill 2 is a 3 rd  person experience for the Playstation 2 console. T he protagonist is 
James Sunderland who is drawn to Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his dead wife Mary, 
asking him to meet her there. 
 
Background  
 
 Silent Hill 2 will be a continuation of the franch ise, a similar feel to the first game, with 
entirely new technical methods of implementation. A lthough the game will use a brand new 
custom engine, many core concepts from the Playstat ion predecessor will transposed into the 
new engine code. The reason behind this is the prev ious success of the Silent Hill engine, which 
allowed us to create an atmosphere truly unique for  the franchise.  
 Many of the previous team (Team Silent) will be wo rking on this project with the 
exception of previous director Keiichiro Toyama . 
 
Description  
 
 Silent Hill 2 like the first game, places the play er at the floor of the town with lots of 
questions and no answers. It is the players job to unravel the mystery of what happened to 
attract the protagonist to the town, be that killin g lots of monsters, or avoiding as many fights 
as possible. The few things they cannot avoid are p uzzles and the horrifying truth the game has 
to offer about the circumstances of your avatars ar rival.

 Key Features  
  
 Silent Hill:  
Silent Hill 2 will allow players to explore more of  the original games location, 
revealing new and disturbing areas. 
 
 Compelling New Story:  
  Silent Hill 2 will feature a brand new story set in the Silent Hill universe, with 
brand new characters, puzzles and monsters. 
  
 Graphics:  
  With all new graphics and real to life CG movies,  Silent Hill 2 will really immerse 
players into the game, creating natural characters and breath taking environments. The game 
will really push for high cinematic quality in both  game play and cut scenes. 
 
 Dynamic Camera Angles:  
  Silent Hill 2 will use periodically fixed camera angles to intensify the game play, 
similar to the first game. This adds to the cinemat ic approach the game will take. 
 
 Sound:  
  The game will contain a completely new soundtrack  composed by Akira Yamaoka 
who created the soundtrack for the first game. The game will also use S-Force technology to 
create a more immersive sound. 
 Difficulty:  
  The difficulty for Silent Hill 2 will be set in 2  categories. Riddle level and Enemy 
level. You can set the level respectively for each individually, using a 3 tier method. 
 
Genre  
 
 Silent Hill 2 like its predecessor falls neatly so mewhere between survival horror and 
psychological horror, though unlike the previous ga me, the psychological horror in Silent Hill 2 
will be more apparent. This is due to the story hav ing a more direct approach, and a more 
explicit subject matter.

 Game Mechanics  
Core Game play  
 The core game play in “Silent Hill 2” will be a mix  of both fighting “monsters” and solving 
puzzles, both of which serve your progress in the g ame. 
 Fighting – The fighting in “Silent Hill 2” will be  based much around its survival horror 
counterpart “Resident Evil”. What will set the comb at apart from our counterparts is the overall 
style and pace of the game. Unlike the previous gam e and much of the “Resident Evil” series, 
players will be more inclined to avoid battles enti rely because of the disturbing nature of their 
design and sound. A slew of enemies will be roaming  the streets, including back alleys and 
hidden under cars. When it comes to interior explor ation, enemies will be dotted around 
corridors and rooms, but sparsely enough to maintai n the feeling of isolation and fear. The 
game works heavily on the concept that what you don ’t see, makes you increasingly scared. An 
example of this would be to have a long dark corrid or with nothing but doors to explore. The 
player cannot see to the other end of the corridor,  creating the fear that something is at the 
end of the corridor, making the player move apprehe nsively to the other end. A possible way to 
describe the combat in “Silent Hill 2” is to compar e it to other survival horror games. For 
example,  in survival games such as Resident Evil, you will walk down a corridor with a sick 
feeling in your stomach, and then all of a sudden a  dog will jump out and attack you. You can 
kill the dog and end the threat until more enemies come along, usually a horde of zombies. 
 In Silent Hill, you will walk down a corridor with  a sick feeling in your stomach, and 
nothing will happen, the threat doesn’t start and i t never ends. Killing one nurse in a somewhat 
abandoned hospital is not enough to know you’re saf e. The fixed camera angles that were a 
core characteristic of the first game will return, to help intensify this feeling of isolation and 
apprehension. The two main ways of detecting these monsters will be a flashlight for visual 
detection, and a radio that emits static when a mon ster is nearby. Both these methods allow 
the player to be warned of danger, but the sensory perception of the monsters mean that 
danger is most certainly on its way. Incidentally, if James leaves his flashlight off in dark areas, 
the screen will increasingly gain brightness, imita ting the effect that his eyes are getting used to 
the dark.  
 Puzzles – The Puzzles in “Silent Hill 2” will trul y attempt to break usual puzzle solving 
conventions in the genre. Opposed to the usual puzz le solving which would remove you from 
Oliver James Cooke  09000916 
12  
 the immersion of the world, the intention here is t o incorporate the necessary “pieces of the 
puzzle” into the narrative. Instead of the cliché “ there is a hole here for a crest, go and find it”. 
The style of the puzzles in “Silent Hill 2” will de fiantly reflect the atmosphere and underlying 
narrative of the game. The audience is promoted to think hard about the solutions, giving the 
players neither the task of collection, nor the tac tic of try every combination. This method was 
incorporated in the first Silent Hill at heart. The  puzzles could be cracked via trial and error, but 
the iconography surrounding the puzzle made it incr easingly disturbing. 
Game Flow  
 Typical game flow in “Silent Hill 2” will be norma lly quite linear. Players will be given a 
portion of the narrative, then be given a reason in  that narrative to explore a certain section of 
the town, which will be usually an indoor section ( levels). On entering the section, they will 
encounter 3 things consistently, 
- Enemies 
- A puzzle or puzzles 
- Multiple narrative sections, with one or two intens e plot progression scenes 
Once the “level” is over, the same basic sequence w ill happen, filling in a lot of the story 
and giving the player a reason to continue their pr ogression through the game. Scattered 
between the usual game flow conventions will be spe cial “set pieces”, which will act as a buffer 
between two locations in the game, and will mostly house a cut scene, fleshing out characters 
or plot."

Characters  
 
James Sunderland 
 
 James is bought to Silent Hill after receiving a l etter from 
his dead wife of 3 years, Mary. James is not the ty pe of person to 
turn into a mad man, he is calm and rational. Despi te this he must 
go to Silent Hill to understand what is going on. P lagued by his 
own doubts and a small hope he may be reunited with  his wife, 
James ventures on into Silent Hill to attempt to un cover the 
truth as to what is going on. James must now deciph er what is 
real and what is his imagination, in his search for  Mary. 
 
Mary Sunderland 
 
 Silent Hill holds many precious memories for Mary and her 
husband. She enjoyed the visit so much that she mad e James promise 
to take her back. Unfortunately that was not a poss ibility, as 3 years 
ago she fell victim to a fatal illness. The letter James receives is 
undoubtedly Marys handwriting, but dead people cant  write letters, 
can they? 
Laura 
 
 Laura moves through the streets of Silent 
Hill with no fear and fully relaxed. She is stubbor n, self willed and 
appears to be much older mentally than she looks ph ysically. Laura

Eddie Dombrowski 
 
 Eddie like James is not from Silent Hill and was 
“summoned” to the town. Eddie appears frightened an d 
helpless to what the town has to offer him. The tow n offers 
nothing to Eddie but monsters and ridicule, though something 
never quite seems right about Eddie, like he’s not all there. 
 
 
Angela Orosco 
 
 Angela comes to Silent Hill to find her family, mu ch like 
James is. She almost harnesses a split personality,  being polite, 
scared and violent, all in the same discourse. Ange la is 
extremely paranoid and throughout the game she slow ly moves 
into insanity.  
 
 
Maria 
 
 Maria and Mary practically look identical, all be it a change 
of hair and clothes. Mary is  a mysterious characte r who never 
lets on what she really knows. She consistently ask s James to 
save her from the danger that Silent Hill has to of fer. Tagging 
along with James, she spends a lot  of time in very  precarious 
positions.

Monsters  
 
 The tables below dictate how many hits/shots it ta kes to vanquish each monster. “X” 
means no damage can be dealt. “!” means the weapon cannot reach the enemy. “0” means the 
weapon is introduced later than the monster still r emains in the game. 
 
Lying Figure

Creeper 
 
 
 The creeper is a small insect that normally travel  in groups. They 
will only attack if you block their path. This mons ter isn’t particularly 
aggressive, normally biting once or twice before le aving.

Flesh Lip 
 
 
 This monster is encountered when Laura locks James  in a room 
looking for Mary’s letter. The flesh lip hangs from  the ceiling in a cage 
much like Maria is killed in at the end of the game . It resembles a body 
bag with legs extruding out of the bottom, which it  uses to strangle its 
victim.  
 
 
 
 
Pyramid Headed Monster 
 
 The pyramid headed monster confronts James numerou s times 
throughout the game, like a bad nightmare for James . James cannot defeat 
this monster, all he can do is escape. It attacks w ith a great sword or a 
spear, and when its attacks connect, deals a deadly  amount of damage.  
This monster holds psychological meaning to James, which the player 
learns at the end of the game.

 Game Play Elements  
 
FlashLight & Radio 
 
The flashlight helps James see in the dark, helping  him to see important items and 
monsters. Equally having the flashlight on makes Ja mes easier to be spotted by danger. The 
radio helps James detect nearby enemies, emitting a  loud static when danger is nearby. Like the 
flashlight, the radio can also draw attention to Ja mes. The radio does not work for normal 
transmissions. 
 
James ’ Personal Items 
 
 James’ personal items consist of a photo of Mary a nd a letter from Mary. 
 
 
Oliver James Cooke  09000916 
21  
  
Health Items 
 
 When used, the health drink restores 25% health. T his item is fairly common. The first 
aid kit can restore 50% of health. This item is con siderably rare. The Ampoule has the ability to 
restore 100% of health. This item is extremely rare  and wont present itself easily. 
 
Blunt Weapons 
 
 The plank is the first weapon in the game. It deli vers limited damage and has a limited 
range. The Steel pipe swings faster, does medium da mage and has a medium range. Both can 
deliver light and heavy attacks. 
 
 
 
 
 
Oliver James Cooke  09000916 
22  
  
Firearms 
 
 The three firearms in the game are the pistol, sho tgun and hunting rifle. The pistol has a 
high rate of fire, holds 10 bullets and does a limi ted amount of damage. The Shotgun has a 
slower rate of fire, holds 6 bullets and is extreme ly effective in close range combat. The hunting 
rife has an extremely low rate of fire, holds 4 bul lets and does and extreme amount of damage 
from close or far away. All three require ammo, whi ch is placed around the game. 
 
 
Other Weapons 
 
 The great knife is the same weapon used by the pyr amid headed monster. It is the 
slowest weapon in the game, but can normally kill a nything with one swing. The chainsaw is 
extremely effective in close range combat, but can only be used after a brief waiting period to 
start the chainsaw up.  
 
 
 
 
Oliver James Cooke  09000916 
23  
  
Keys 
 
 There are a selection of keys throughout the game that open a variety of things like 
doors or chests.  
 
Various Puzzle Items 
 
 These puzzle items will be used in order to unlock  new items needed to progress the 
story. Some can be manipulated and others are just required to be used correctly."

Game Physics and Statistics  
  
 Movement – James has 3 primary speeds, walk, jog a nd run. The player can primarily 
walk anywhere at a set pace, the act of walking lon g distances will not take an effect on the 
avatar. The next two speeds jog and run, are determ ined by how “tired” James  is, this will 
usually be calculated by how long James  has been r unning consistently. If James runs for a long 
distance it will eventually slow into a jog, after a period of jogging James will then burst into 
running until “tired” again. This cool down time ca n be reduced by walking as opposed to 
jogging. The tactic of running then stopping just b efore James gets tired, then bursting into 
another lengthy run, will be abolished and will be calculated on how much running James has 
done on average. These 3 speeds can be further alte red by being injured. Having James’ health 
drop below a certain threshold will reduce the spee d of usual movement. James is also able to 
sidestep to the left and right, as well as perform a 180 degree turn. 
 
Combat – The rate of combat depends on which weapon  the player decided to arm 
James with some close combat weapons will take long er to strike, but will inherently deal more 
damage. This idea can be easily transposed to firea rms by allowing the better weapons to deal 
more damage, but taking longer to reload, leaving t he avatar prone to attacks. When enemies 
get attacked, they react to the damage depending on  their current health. This can mean they 
will either be stopped from moving, get pushed back  or fall to the floor. When James gets hit, 
there is a brief moment after that the player becom es prone to extra attacks and cannot 
defend, just as if someone was pushed over in real life. James also has the ability to coup de 
grace enemies that are in a prone position; he acco mplishes this by stamping on them.  
 
Artificial Intelligence  
  
 The enemies in the game will react with two basic senses, sight and sound. These two 
senses will give the AI an impression of carnal att acks. Unlike the “Resident Evil” series in which 
the zombies attack with a need to feed, the monster s in “Silent Hill 2” attack with nothing more 
than basic instinct.  
 Sight – Enemies work on a radial system primarily.  The basic theory is, if James gets too 
close to the enemy, the enemy will advance with int ent to harm. Some enemies when hit to the 
floor, will have the ability to crawl away from Jam es at a fast pace, exiting the players sight 
from the screen. This is used as a general regroupi ng mechanism for the enemies, in which they 
then have time to stand up and perform better attac ks, as opposed to attacking from the floor. 
In places of darkness, the radial system is depende nt on the flashlight James carries. If the  
Oliver James Cooke  09000916 
26  
  
flashlight is turned off then the enemy radius is d ramatically reduced and will only attack if the 
player near enough bumps into the enemy. 
 Sound – Enemies can also base attacks from the sou nds they hear. The sound of 
footsteps and the radio which James carries, act as  a beacon for enemies. In turn the enemies 
will advance to the source of the noise and attack James. Enemies will not hear the footsteps of 
James while walking. 
 The only time these two rules do not apply to the enemies AI is if there is a specific “set 
piece”, in which the enemy is scripted to act in a certain way.

Overall Goals Overall Goals Overall Goals Overall Goals     
 
 Artistic style was a true staple for the previous game, Silent Hill 2 will intend to bring the 
same motifs of the first game with unbelievable vib rancy and character, into this generation of 
consoles. The true artistic goal of this project is  based on a concept of simultaneous repulsion 
and attraction, to define their impact to the playe r. Interior environments will look abandoned 
and disgusting, but at the same time will have a di stinct charm. Almost like grim visual 
backgrounds and set pieces will have an aura of mys tery about them. The exterior 
environments will be treated differently. The town will be given a true sense of isolation by lack 
of interactivity, making the town seem bigger that it really is. One key sequence intended for 
implementation is the extended walk to the town of Silent Hill. We intentionally want this 
sequence to be long, as to give the player a true f eeling that the town is isolated and soon you 
will be. Additionally the game will have a grainy f ilter for the entirety of the game, to dirty the 
images and give them character. In addition, variou s artistic decisions placed around the game 
will give the player subliminal help with understan ding the story. One idea of which is finding a 
person dead slumped in a chair, the exact character  model will be of the main character James, 
but the art direction of the body will make it only  slightly distinguishable as your character. All 
of these visual elements will aid each other to con vey a mysterious feeling of solitude and 
isolation, which is the true nature of the game. 
 The monsters in the game will also adopt this meth od of simultaneous repulsion and 
attraction. The monsters are not extremely abstract  from human anatomy, giving the player a 
fear of relation to the very things they are scared  of or even kill. Hits of sexuality will be 
intentionally placed in the art direction, making t he nurse’s clothes rather short, and the 
mannequins legs silky smooth. These intentional dec isions are implemented to heighten the 
male insinuation of the pyramid head monster, a mal e slaughtering and suggestively 
sodomizing the female related monsters.  
 The human characters will take on a mundane approa ch on purpose. None of them are 
meant to be super heroes and imperfections are need ed to appreciate the fragility of the lives 
at stake. All of the characters except Laura have s kin imperfections and extremely normal 
clothes. Incidentally the same face is used for bot h Mary and Maria, further strengthening their 
roles in the story.

 Sound and Music  
 
Overall goals Overall goals Overall goals Overall goals     
 
 The overall goal of the effects direction is to re move itself from the formality of other 
such survival horror games, such as the “Resident E vil” series. The intentions are to make 
sounds that have a physical reaction with the playe r, almost like there is something crawling 
underneath your skin. As opposed to the usual sound s you would hear every day being used in 
a different context.   
 The musical composition and sound effects in the g ame will be entirely handled by Akira 
Yamaoka.  The main theme for the game was composed before this document was made, 
based entirely off the script. The rest of the musi cal composition will convey the true 
melancholy of the script, which like the game, will  use unlikely combinations to portray a 
distinct feeling to the player.  
 
Sound Effects Sound Effects Sound Effects Sound Effects    & Music & Music & Music & Music     
 
 To prevent repetition many of the “mundane” sounds  being used will be sampled 
multiple times. For example opening a door will not  always have the same opening sound, and 
footsteps will be different every pace. The more un usual effects will be comprised from 
numerous different sources, from synthesized sounds , to multiple overlays of samples from 
animals. 
 The music throughout the game will have a constant  motif of melancholy. There will 
obviously be no upbeat, major key jingles for compl eting milestones in game. Even upon picking 
up crucial items to progress the story, the jingle will be small and minor key. A lot of the music 
could be reused during similar sequences, but also,  silence will be a key contributing factor, 
setting suspense and mood for the player.  
Combinations of sad melodies with strong beats, abs tract synthesized composition and 
elegant piano pieces, will really set the tone for the game and bring out the games fragile story. 
A contrast of the ugly and the beautiful, or as sta ted before, repulsion and attraction.

 Story  
 
 The beginning of the game introduces James Sunderl and, the main character and 
avatar of the player. The game starts with James on  the cusp of Silent Hill, standing on the 
observation deck overlooking Toluca Lake. James has  travelled to Silent Hill after receiving a 
letter from his wife Mary, who had apparently died from an illness 3 years prior to James’ 
return to the town. The letter James possesses stat es that Mary is waiting for him in their 
“special place”. This somewhat confuses James, as t he whole town itself could be seen as their 
“special place”. James considers that the park by t he lake could be the location the letter 
mentions, and decides to leave the observation deck  and head to town.  
 
 After a small amount of travel, James runs into a teenage girl by the name of Angela, 
in a graveyard. Angela is startled by James, showin g a sheer disbelief when James mentions that 
he is lost. Angela states she is looking for her fa mily in Silent Hill and points James in the right 
direction. James eventually reaches the town to rea lise to once beautiful town he and Mary 
once loved, is now no more. A fog shrouds the entir ety of the towns rotting abandonment, as 
well as the humanoid monsters roaming the streets, waiting to attack James. With the initial 
route to Rosewater Park blocked, James is forced to  find another route, so he decides to try 
another route, through Woodside Apartments."
"Oliver James Cooke  09000916 
37  
  Inside the apartments, James meets up with Eddie, who is vomiting in a toilet. Eddie 
defensively denies his involvement with a dead body  laying only a few feet away from him. 
Eddie like James claims to have been summoned to th e town, and can not quite understand 
their own rational for being there. It is here that  James also runs into a little girl called Laura. 
Laura appears to be immune to the effects the town appears to be having on James. She also 
has an unexplained loathing for James, as well as k nowing the identity of Mary.  
 
 After taking a small leap into the parallel Blue C reek Apartments, James runs into 
Angela again, but this time lying on the floor in o ne of the rooms wielding a knife. Angela 
portrays a more sporadic mood of fear, aggression a nd politeness, all in the same discourse 
with James. Fearing she may be suicidal, James acqu ires the knife from Angela and she leaves in 
a flurry of emotions. During this time James encoun ters the Pyramid headed monster for the 
first time, sodomizing and killing other monsters i n various locations around the apartments. 
Nothing in James arsenal will kill the monster, and  James decides to flee. 
 
 When James finally reaches his destination, he is met by Maria, who is near enough 
identical to Mary, with the exception of more provo cative clothes and an attitude to match. 
Maria appears to have insight into situations that only James or Mary would have, talking 
intelligently about Mary’s death and other “special  places”. James denominates that The 
Lakeview Hotel could be the “special place” Mary ta lks about, thus that will be his next 
destination. There are no boats at the dock to cros s Toluca Lake to reach the hotel, so naturally, 
James must find another way. Though not alone, as M aria guilt trips James into letting her 
accompany him. James detours through the bowling al ley meeting back up with Eddie and a 
quick exiting Laura. Eddie refuses to chase after L aura and opts to stay and eat pizza. On James’ 
exit from the bowling alley, Maria claims to have c hased the little girl and convinces James they 
need to find her out of concern."
"Oliver James Cooke  09000916 
38  
  
 The chase leads them to Brookhaven Hospital, where  upon entering Maria falls 
increasingly tired and decides to stay in one of th e rooms, leaving James to find Laura. James 
finds Laura and learns that she has known Mary for the last year, James argues this point 
implying that it is impossible, for this, Laura loc ks him in a room full of monsters under the false 
information that the room contained a letter from M ary. After the monsters are defeated, the 
hospital undergoes an “other worldly” transformatio n and in this other world, Maria is missing. 
James finds Maria in the hospitals basement and aft er a small reunion; they are chased by the 
Pyramid headed monster. Attempting to make a quick escape down a winding corridor, James 
successfully makes it to the elevator, but Maria is  not so lucky, getting trapped behind the half 
closed elevator doors. The Pyramid headed monster k ills Maria for James to see, and James is 
again alone. Upon exiting the elevator, James notic es Laura make a hasty exit from the hospital. 
Outside the hospital, behind a statue lies a key to  the Silent Hill Historical Society, James’ next 
destination.  
 
 The Historical Society opens up to two locations n ot on the Silent Hill map. First the 
Toluca Prison and then leading off that is the Laby rinth. The Labyrinth is where the Pyramid 
headed monster resides and is also miraculously whe re James finds Maria, alive in cell which 
she sensually asks James to come and get her. James  is unable to rescue her as by the time he 
finds the route to her cell door; she is dead, kill ed by the Pyramid headed monster again. It is in 
the Labyrinth that both Angela and Eddie find valid ity of their beaconing to Silent Hill. 
Documents found in the prison imply that Angela kil led her father after many years of physical 
and sexual abused condoned by her mother. James res cues a distressed Angela from a 
monstrous incarnation of her father, only to receiv e more animosity and anger from Angela. 
Eddie by this point has been forced to snap by the Labyrinth, disclosing that he killed a football 
player, a dog, and then shot the dog’s owner. It is  apparent that by the time Eddie entered 
Silent Hill he had in fact gone insane, killing any one who so much as looked at him funny. This"
"Oliver James Cooke  09000916 
39  
 insanity quickly focuses on James, who is forced to  shamefully kill Eddie in self defence. It is 
killing Eddie that forces James to seriously consid er his reason for being in the town. 
 
 James exits the Labyrinth and acquires a small row boat to cross the lake to the hotel. 
On his arrival James notes that the hotel hasn’t ch anged since his last visit 3 years ago. Inside 
James finds Laura, who is considerably more co oper ative now. She gives James a letter that 
Mary wrote, which states that Mary wanted to adopt Laura, and gave substantial evidence that 
Laura had in fact know Mary for the past year. The truth is revealed to James after he enters 
the room which he and Mary shared; containing a vid eotape he apparently left in the room 3 
years ago. The video tape played a home movie of Ma ry in the room of the hotel, speaking 
fondly of Silent Hill, then the video dramatically changes, showing static filled images of James 
smothering his terminally ill wife with a pillow. L aura finds James and expresses her wishes to 
carry on looking for Mary. James reveals to Laura t hat he in fact killed Mary, which makes Laura 
upset and she abruptly leaves. It is at this point that the radio James has been carrying with him 
picks up a transmission, which sounds like Marys vo ice asking James to find her. On his exit 
from the room, the whole of the hotel has taken a d rastic chance of decor. The walls are now 
burnt out and water is leaking everywhere, like the re had been a fire. Further inspecting the 
hotel, James finds Angela standing on a burning sta ircase. She asks James back for the knife so 
she can commit suicide, but James refuses to give i t to her, Angela believes James is saving it for 
himself, but James reinforces that he would never t ake his own life. Angela starts ascending the 
stairs and James makes a comment stating “it’s hot as hell in here”, Angela replies “you see it 
too? It’s always like this for me”, signifying that  Angela’s life was a constant living hell. She 
ascends the staircase to an undetermined fate."

  James continues to encounter Maria yet again who i s screaming out for his help. 
Maria is then killed violently in front of James by  two of the Pyramid headed monsters. James 
falls to his knees and begins to realise that the t wo monsters were created to punish him for his 
sins, and that he does not need them anymore. The t wo pyramid heads impale themselves and 
James is left to continue through a metal style com plex with a long winding ascent, and the 
stories climax. 
 
 
Multiple endings Multiple endings Multiple endings Multiple endings     
 
“Leave” Ending 
 At the top of the metal steps James finds what he assumes to be Mary, but is in fact 
Maria in Mary’s clothes. James tells Maria that he doesn’t need her anymore, but Maria intends 
to take James down with her. Maria transforms into a monster and James kills her. After Maria 
is dead, the scene changes to James at Mary’s bed. James asks Mary for forgiveness, stating 
that his reason for killing her was because he want ed his life back and he hated her. Mary 
forgives him in the sense that she asks him to do o ne last thing for her, and go on with his life. 
Mary hands James a letter and she passes away. 
 Mary’s letter is read aloud and in full as opposed  to the section James reads at the 
beginning of the game. After, James and Laura are s een at the graveyard where James met 
Angela, and they leave Silent Hill together. It is insinuated that James fulfilled Marys wishes and 
adopted Laura. 
 
 “In Water” Ending 
 
 The same set up as the “Leave” ending, but after M aria is dead an altered end scene 
occurs. Instead of Mary accepting James’ plea for f orgiveness, she abruptly tells him that he is 
paying for what he has done. Mary hands James a let ter and passes away. After this scene 
James is seen carrying Marys body out of the room. The screen turns black the audience hears a 
car starting, while James expresses that he didn’t know why he was so scared. The audience 
hears a loud splash and Marys full letter is read."
"Oliver James Cooke  09000916 
41  
 “Maria” Ending 
 
 When James reaches the top of the stair case he fi nds Mary. He explains he came all 
this way just to have the possibility to see her ag ain, but Mary is angry. Despite his best efforts 
to explain his actions to Mary, she verbally attack s James, stating she could never forgive James 
for what he did. She transforms into a monster and James eliminates her. After Mary is dead, 
the scene changes to James and Maria by a bridge. J ames decides to leave Silent Hill with 
Maria, stating that Mary is not there anymore and h e wants to be with Maria.  
 Marys Letter is read out in full. After it is read  out, Maria and James start to ascend a 
set of stairs back to the start location of the gam e. Maria gives out a small cough in which 
James retorts “You’d better do something about that  cough”. 
 
“Rebirth” Ending 
 
 This ending sees James take on Maria at the top of  the steps and after she is defeated, 
the scene changes to James rowing the same boat he used to get to the hotel. It is implied that 
Mary is dead in the boat with James, expressing how  he cannot go on without her. James 
finishes with the sentences, “This town, Silent Hil l. The Old Gods haven't left this place.  And 
they still grant power to those who venerate them. Power to defy even death.” 
 James intends to resurrect Mary somehow, how is le ft up to the players imagination 
but with James and Laura the only two people left a live, it would suggest a sacrifice.  
 
“Dog” Ending 
 
 This ending is the comic relief ending. Through me ans denoted by game play, James 
stumbles in on a Dog controlling multiple computers . James falls to his knees and says “It was 
you all along!”. The dog proceeds to lick James’ Fa ce. This ending is unattainable by fighting the 
end boss."

 Level Overview  
 
 Silent Hill consists of 2 “worlds”, the “normal” w orld of a derelict town and the 
demonic repulsive other world. The map layouts for this demonic world to not inherently 
manipulate the geometry of the surroundings, instea d they unlock previously locked doors, 
leading to whole new section of a building. 
 Below is a series of maps, each with specific even ts listed. As well as the puzzles 
encountered within the level, and their respective solutions. 
 
Silent Hill Silent Hill Silent Hill Silent Hill    
    
 The Decor of Silent Hill is that of a derelict nat ure, although there is a distinguishable 
essence of community about it. The fog that encases  the town almost washes out any colour 
the town previously had to offer. A lot of the busi ness’ appear to be small independent 
ventures, not noticeably having a huge shopping out let. The only main attraction is the Lake 
Side Amusement Park which sits behind the Hotel, th ough the peace and tranquillity of the 
town could be seen as an attraction by many. Abando ned cars and monsters are the main 
things cluttering the streets of Silent Hill now."

Woodside Apartments 
  The Apartments are relatively run down with paint p eeling off the walls. Not much 
clutters the halls but each room has been uniquely used. A rusted stairwell spans the 3 floors of 
the apartment block, each floor containing monsters . James meets Eddie for the first time in 
this apartment block, as well as encountering the p yramid headed monster."

Blue Creek Apartments 
 
 The Blue Creek Apartments was built next to the Wo odside Apartments. Blue Creek is 
accessible through Woodside, by using a fire escape  that was knocked down to allow room for 
Blue Creek. The decor is near identical to Woodside  Apartments, except for the distinct hint of 
blue pain in the hallways. Monsters still roam the hallways, and a second appearance from the 
pyramid headed monster is made. James also runs int o Angela here for the second time, and 
convinces her to give him her knife."
"Oliver James Cooke  09000916 
47  
 Brookhaven Hospital 
 
 Brookhaven Hospital has a distinct decor, containi ng abandoned medical equipment, 
operating tables and wheelchairs in the hallways. T he walls have also seen better days, showing 
signs of plaster falling from them, and in some sec tions, ceilings entirely caved in. Brookhaven is 
the first place to undergo the other worldly transf ormation. Doors become blocked by boxes or 
materials, the walls are covered in tarp and many n ew disturbing noises can be heard, 
especially a pig squealing in the basement. This bu ilding has an intense feeling of abandonment 
and a distinct void of life. James suffers another encounter with the pyramid headed monster 
here, as well as having Laura lock him in the exami nation room."
"Oliver James Cooke  09000916 
48  
  
Toluca Prison 
 
 The Toluca Prison is not situated on any map of Si lent Hill, but in game it will appear to 
be situated underneath the Silent Hill Historical S ociety. The prison is separated into three main 
sections, dictated by the long corridors between th em. The far left of the map comprises of 
visiting rooms and civilian offices. The middle sec tion holds the cells and other such rooms like 
shower rooms and inmate essentials. The far right i s the prison courtyard. When the alternate 
world is triggered, the courtyard quickly shifts to  a field of gallows, it is here that James finds hi s 
own gravestone. The decor is drastically caged and run down. The floors are covered with a 
combination of dirt and blood. Just like the hospit al, the prison has the feeling of a severe void 
of life, except for the monsters roaming the hallwa ys."
"Oliver James Cooke  09000916 
49  
 The Labyrinth 
 
 The Labyrinth is situated below the prison and has  the appearance of a derelict 
unused building. The walls look in relatively good shape except for a few red stains across a 
small amount of the walls. This section is where th e pyramid headed monster appears to 
reside, and where James is able to enter what seems  to be his workshop and steal his weapon. 
The pyramid headed monster is also seen roaming the  halls of the lower labyrinth. The halls 
look relatively similar with numerous ladders and d oors, making it easy to get lost in. 
Symbolically, this location is the place when the k ey characters overcome their own “mental 
maze”."
"Oliver James Cooke  09000916 
50  
 Lakeview Hotel 
 When James arrives at Lakeview Hotel it appears to  be just how he remembers it. The 
hotel seems to be in good shape, with floral wallpa per and a grand piano, it looks like a nice 
place to stay. The whole hotel is caked in a layer of dust though, further encompassing that 
isolation and desertion. Once James sees the tape i ndicated in the story, the whole hotel 
changes into the charred remains of a hotel, like i t had been burnt down. The hotel comprises 
of three floors and a basement, monsters roam befor e and after the dramatic change."

 Market Analysis  
Target Market Target Market Target Market Target Market     
 Silent Hill will be developed for the Playstation 2. This platform was chosen as it has a 
huge install base, which will enable to game to rec eive a wide reception of audiences. The 
Playstation platform has proven to be the stable gr ound for the mature style of game. Silent Hill 
released on the Playstation as well as the Resident  Evil series, which did extremely well. 
Continuing previous success, we believe the same co nsumers of these titles will have converted 
to the upgraded Playstation 2 hardware, thus the in stall base denotes our market within that 
platform. Although sales show the first Silent Hill  game did not create as much hype or profit as 
the Resident Evil series, numerous publishing bodie s congratulated the game as being 
extremely innovative. We intend to further attract the niche audience our first game created 
and expand beyond that, enticing new players to enj oy the psychological horror. These new 
players will be placed in the 13 to 25 age range, w e chose this as younger players will revel in 
the combat and gore aspect, while older players wil l get more enjoyment from the story and 
the puzzles. Typically the game will aim at a male audience, though the standard of the art 
direction could considerably influence a female aud ience. 
Top Performers Top Performers Top Performers Top Performers     
 Silent Hill 2 will be the first big release for th e genre on a new operating platform. We 
can see other titles prom the previous generation w hich proves the genre is strong. Such titles 
like Clock Tower reinvented the genre by changing t he pace of combat, making is truly about 
surviving the horror as opposed to shooting everyth ing. Clock Tower went on to split audiences, 
until it too, created their niche audience. The Res ident Evil series, though extremely differently 
paced to Silent Hill, delivered the classic surviva l horror experience. Multiple encounters, 
sudden exhilarating rushes and fantastic art design . It is this pattern which will allow Silent Hill 2  
to be a success for not only the platform but the g enre. Silent Hill 2 will bring its distinctive styl e 
to the table of the next generation, and hopefully broaden the genre for years to come.

 Feature Comparison Feature Comparison Feature Comparison Feature Comparison     
 The main comparison for Silent Hill 2 from previou s games will be the obvious graphical 
leap. The story will harness the power of the platf orm to deliver stunning visuals and 
unprecedented emotional involvement. The sound qual ity will be a major improvement and so 
will the resolution our game will be playable in. M odels and textures will be substantially 
clearer, with a better capability to encapsulate mo re on screen at once. The vibration function 
of the Playstation 2 controller will also add numer ous enhancements to the game play 
experience. Silent Hill 2 will continue its predece ssor’s staple on the market, reinventing 
psychological horror through a level of storytellin g maturity not seen in the genre."

QUICK INTRO  
7/12/07 8:25:39 PM  VERSION 1.5  
 
“Only cowards die once.”  
- Last Rites Motto - 
 
 
O WHAT IS THIS GAME?  
 
Last Rites is an isometric role -playing game that takes place in TSR’s 
Planescape  setting.   
 
It uses the Bioware Forgotten Realms engine with Interplay artists supplying the 
Planescape ambiance and feel.  
 
The player creates a single character. Over the course of the game, the player 
picks and chooses a series of allies (pals and romantic i nterests) to join his party 
and allow him to kick ass more efficiently. The maximum party size at any one 
time is five.  
 
O “PLANESCAPE?”  WHAT‟s THAT? A DISEASE?  
 
Planescape is one of TSR’s “worlds” (like Forgotten Realms ) that uses the 
Advanced Dungeons and Dragons (AD&D) rules system.  
 
The “world” of Planescape is actually a misnomer…the Planescape setting is 
composed of a series of “planes” (other dimensions) that rotate around a central 
city, Sigil, like spokes on a wheel.  
 
The city of Sigil is the cen tral fixture of the Planescape universe. Also called the 
“Cage” or the “City of Doors,” it‟s unique in that scattered throughout its 
labyrinth of city streets are portals (some hidden, some obvious) that lead to 
anywhere  in existence, provided you have the proper key. It is neutral ground and 
watering hole for races across the multiverse, all under the watchful shadow of the 
Lady of Pain, the enigmatic ruler of the city.  
 
8:25 PM  07/12/07  Last Rites Product Review Packet  Page 3 of 47  
Last Rites Team  Version 1.5   Overall, Planescape is a more adult, hard -core fantasy setting compared to other 
TSR worlds. The architecture, the people, the creatures…everything has an edge 
to it. Belief, emotions, faith and other abstracts actually make their presence felt 
on reality…in Planescape, belief has the power to reshape worlds, kill and 
resurrect powers (gods) and change the laws of physics.  
 
O SPECS: WHAT‟S THE TARGET SYSTEM?  
 
We‟re looking at a 16MB Pentium 90 with a 2x/4x CD ROM drive and a 2 meg 
Video Card. The game will be a multi -CD game (3 CDs).  
 
 
 
 
  
 This bagel -shaped thing off 
to the right here is city of 
Sigil. It‟s where you start 
the game.  
 
 
Down here‟s the 
ground.  (Sigil‟s like a big 
cream -filled doughnut 
except instead of 
cream filling, there‟s 
this city inside. No 
one‟s really sure how 
they live like this, but 
whatever. It‟s pretty 
tame compared to 
most of the shit you 
find in Planescape.)

PLANESCAPE CRPG  
LAST RITES  
VISION STATEMENT  
 
Contained herein are all the hopes and dreams for this project.  
 
 
overview  
 
O  WHAT IS THIS GAME?  
  
Last Rites  is a violent, irreverent and breathtakingly beautiful RPG set at the 
crossroads of the multiverse. We intend to create an amusingly eccentric, mind -
spinning, cliché -breaking power fantasy splashed with visceral moments of 
breathtaking violence. The specifics of how we will accomplish this are detailed 
in the pages to follow.  
 
Set in the TSR world of Planescape , Last Rites will be using the Bioware  
Forgotten Realms CRPG  engine as a base for the game, and Interplay artists and 
designers will supply the Planescape ambiance.  
 
The brief story summary‟s below, followed by a list of all the cool shit we plan to 
include in the game.  
 
 
 
O  THE HIGH CONCEPT  
  
The player is a scarred, amnesiac immortal in search of his identity. On the 
way, the player character will kill a lot of people…including himself.  “Sheesh. Can this guy 
write any more text? 
I‟m already bored, 
and I’m fucking 
dead.”  
8:25 PM  07/12/07  Last Rites Product Review Packet  Page 5 of 47  
Last Rites Team  Version 1.5    
The game begins with the character waking up on a cold stone slab in the 
Mortuary, a huge morgue in the city of Sigil. The player character has no idea who 
he is, what he is doing there, and how he died. He must escape and explore the 
strange world beyond the Mortuary walls to uncover the secret of his death and 
rebirth.1 
 
A detailed plot summary has been provided after the vision statement. Now for a 
list of the cool features of this game:  
 
 
 
COOL ENGINE SHIT  
 
O  check out what‟s under the hood  
 
The game engine rocks.  Our game engine has cool stuff in it that the Bioware 
proposal has already outlined i n detail. Each map is 16 -bit color, pre -rendered and 
unique. Characters can step into pools of light and shadow and be illuminated 
appropriately. It has global lighting that allows the world to fluctuate from dawn 
to noon to dusk to night and back again. When your player equips new armor or 
weapons, you can see your character in his new duds. The 2 -click -to-whatever -
you-need interface, over twenty quality spells and spell effects, accommodation 
for a party of up to five characters that the player picks and chooses, and artificial 
intelligence scripting for NPCs (the githzerai in your party will foam at the mouth 
and go berserk on the mind flayer as soon as he sees him, your cowardly thief may 
skip the scene as soon as first blood is drawn, the fickle traitoress in your party 
may wait till you are at 25% hit points and everybody else has fallen unconscious 
before stabbing you in the back) all help round out the engine.  
 
O  TILing is for bathrooms, not games  
 
This game engine don’t tile.  This one deserves spec ial mention since it‟s 
probably the first thing that‟s going to hit a player.  
 
                                                           
1 The story is set up so the player character starts  out with no knowledge of the world he is in. This allows both the player and his 
character to be introduced to the world together as they explore it and gives the player more identification with his charact er. “The point dipshit‟s trying  to 
make is that this will be a  
kick-ass game.”  
8:25 PM  07/12/07  Last Rites Product Review Packet  Page 6 of 47  
Last Rites Team  Version 1.5   Imagine exploring a painted landscape. That‟s what this game does.  
 
No more repetitious dungeon tiles used to construct generic dungeons where 
you‟ve memorized the location of every secret button in every wall texture of the 
cube by cube dungeon. In this game, every inch of the game world will be 
sculpted by an artist. It‟s going be unique, and it‟s going to make our competitors 
cry.  
 
 
 
O  cool animations and humorous sfx  
 
Smilin' art  style. With the art resources we can bring to bear, the creatures in the 
game can have unique animations. Furthermore, each creature and person the 
player meets will have sounds that give them style and character – the sniveling 
goblinoid pimp wipes his nose when he fidgets. The apprentice spellcaster 
practices his cantrips while waiting, little sparkles surrounding his hands and his 
eyes glowing. Your amazonian fighter flexes and poses while she waits. The vain 
captain of the guard combs his hair or admires himself in a mirror. During the 
early stages of the game players can have a sarcastic floating skull, Morte, join 
their party as a companion (his only attack is a bite and the ability to taunt 
creatures into attacking) and he comes armed with a selection of over a hundred 
insults he can spout off at any time (as the player enters new stages of the game, 
the insult menu grows with each new location). When agitated or upset, he zips 
around in a circle, his skull bobbing frantically and his eyes rolling. When near 
female undead, he is scripted to float over them and try out pick -up lines on them. 
When the player is engaged in delicate conversations with other characters in the 
game, he will spin his head around like something from the exorcist or spit teeth 
at the player.  
 
Gameplay ELEMENTS  
 
O  THE GAME IS THE CHARACTER GENERATOR  
 
 You define yourself through your actions, not through pushing a set of 
numbers around on the character generation sc reen.  Your actions in the game 
flesh out the character. You decide how strong you get, which career path to 
follow, the skills you wish to learn, what abilities you develop and what spells you “How can it not be a 
kick ass game? I‟m in 
it.” 
8:25 PM  07/12/07  Last Rites Product Review Packet  Page 7 of 47  
Last Rites Team  Version 1.5   wish to study. The entire game is the character generation screen and allows you 
to build your character to suit your gaming style.  
 
O  inflict pain in ways you won‟t believe  
  
 
 
No more using boring swords, daggers or bows to carve bloody swaths 
through opponents.  Plunge scalpels into foes‟ eyes, lace their food wi th 
poisonous embalming fluid, push them into man -eating pockets of ooze, sic them 
with sarcastic biting skulls, hurl them into razorvines, conjure burrowing rot grubs 
within a victim‟s brain, cast spells that make them bleed from every orifice, or 
change a person‟s scent so they attract packs of hungry rats. Deliver punishment 
in ways that will bring a smile to your face.  
 
O  SPELLS THAT MAKE YOU PITY THE TARGET  
 
 “Fireball” can go hide in the fucking corner when you unleash your arsenal.  
Jam your hand into  an opponent‟s body, rip out his soul and tell it to kill its 
owner. Make a gesture, and summon a blanket of crawling, biting insects to turn 
your enemy into a happy meal. Send your foes on a field trip to hell without a 
permission slip. Taunt someone to death. Summon your darkest shadows from 
across existence and send them into battle to feed on your opponent‟s physical 
strength. Your succubus ally can kiss your opponents to death -- they die with a 
smile on their face.  
 
O  NO apron STRINGS  
 
We don’t baby sit you...do who or what you want to when you want to do it. 
Sure, you‟ll have direction and a goal right from the start, but you have room to 
maneuver, explore and choose your own destiny. Last Rites  isn‟t a condescending 
babysitter that beats you over the head with soft introductions, reassurances and a 
hand -holding mission -spewing wizard to guide you every step of the way. It will 
immerse you in the Planescape world and force you to fend for yourself in a 
challenging environment.  
 
Don‟t be too concerned  about dying during the first few minutes during the game 
– it won‟t happen. You‟ll have plenty of time to explore the world around you and “These headers are stupid. 
„Inflict Pain in Ways you 
won‟t believe.‟ Sheesh. 
It‟s painful enough 
already.”  
8:25 PM  07/12/07  Last Rites Product Review Packet  Page 8 of 47  
Last Rites Team  Version 1.5   get a foothold before your character is genuinely threatened. Besides, in Last 
Rites,  death is only a temporary condition for your character. As you‟ll discover, 
it‟s what you do after  you‟re dead that‟s important – to you and to everybody else.  
 
O  equip gnarly stuff  
 
Equip stuff that scares small children. Pluck out your eye with a scalpel and 
plop in the bloody eyeba ll of a fiendish martyr. Skin a beast you‟ve slain and wear 
it as armor – you can‟t beat the carapace of a bonespear in terms of armor or miss 
the chance to take its horns as javelins. Harvest razorvine into garrotes. Pry open 
the jaws of a Canoleth and carve out its sticky barbed tounge to use a net. 
Dismember an opponent and use his extremities as weapons. Take the molted skin 
of a giant reptile and stitch it into a shield or skin a Quill and wear its spiny fur 
like a cloak.  
 
O  hOLY SHIT, look what happ ened to me! 
 
The player can have horrible, flesh -rending things happen to his character 
on-screen – even die -- and he will get better . What happens to monsters above 
can happen to the player – except that the player will regenerate. The player‟s arm 
can be loped off, his legs severed, his skin flayed from his body, and he‟ll be fine 
in a few hours (and perhaps a little stitching by the Dustmen). In some instances, 
the player will need to lop off his own extremities for use as weapons (arms make 
great clubs !) or free himself from manacles – he can use his deathless state to help 
him solve problems during the adventure.  
 
O  IT‟s A GAME, NOT A THIRST SIMULATOR  
 
 
 
 
We want you to play the fucking game, not micro -manage it. This ain‟t a flight 
sim. Because you‟re effectively immortal, you don‟t need to eat, sleep, excrete, 
nor do you need to worry about dying through any conventional means. There‟s 
no thirst or hunger meters, encumbrance, morality points or micro -management 
that gets in the way of you beating a n opponent to death with his own severed arm 
or casting a spell that teleports an opponent‟s scrotum into his stomach to get 
digested.  
 “The be st part about Ultima 7 
was that you‟re guys were 
always  hungry. There‟s 
nothing like spoon -feeding 
your companions to make you 
feel like a hero. Hellloooo , 
fun!”  
8:25 PM  07/12/07  Last Rites Product Review Packet  Page 9 of 47  
Last Rites Team  Version 1.5   But you do get to manage a party of allies – though they will always have some 
things in their script and attitude that give them quirks that prevent them from 
being predictable (you can give Marta the scullion a battle -axe, but since she 
already expressed her reservations about drawing blood to you earlier in the 
adventure, she won‟t use it in combat – although she‟s deadl y with a heavy rolling 
pin), players still can count on being able to manage combat and fighting to their 
liking.  
 
COOL STORY SHIT  
 
O  There Ain‟t a game world like it  
 
 
 
Planescape  is a game world you’ve NEVER experienced before.  It gouges you 
with its sharp -edged visuals, bizarre adversaries that can murder you with an idea, 
and strange magics that unravel common conceptions about physics and 
metaphysics. Explore Sigil, a city of magic and industry, barnacled within the 
polluted interior of a hollow do ughnut where the mightiest angels and the worst 
horrors vomited from the Pit will invite you to tender your views on how 
mortality affects the physical and emotional relations between the sexes.  
 
Forget fragile elves, rock -humping dwarves, worthless hobbits and with them, the 
mind -numbing boredom of every RPG ever released. Planescape will leave you 
groping for a secure foothold…and just when you think you have a feel for the 
place, the environment will kick you in the ass, changing the rules before your 
thoughts can tumble back into order.  
 
No more high -fantasy -ride-across -the-land-and-uphold -the-good -by-killing -the-
evil-wizard -with-the-magic -sword bullshit.  In this game, you‟re the only one that 
matters, it‟s your life on the line…and the clock doesn‟t stop ticking.  
 “Blah blah blah 
Planescape blah blah 
blah it‟s so special 
blah blah blah we‟re 
so pretentious blah

Last Rites Team  Version 1.5   O  EGO MASTURBATION  
 
 
 
We gots Gold, Glory, Power and Hero Worship.  Why save a world you know 
nothing about and have absolutely no attachment to? Fuck that. We know what 
you really want to do – you want to run rampant in a world where you  are a god. 
You want the power to change your environment, slaughter all who stand against 
you, and be a hero worshipped by the masses – everything you don‟t get pushing 
paper or suffering through school 40 hours a week.  
 
As such , Last Rites  concentrates on every player‟s power fantasy and exploits 
selfish motivations. You and your destiny are the focus the game. You‟re not out 
to save the world, only yourself – and if the world gets saved in the process, then 
fine, but it ain‟t your problem.  
 
Maybe Plane scape doesn‟t revolve around the character – but it would if you 
wanted  it to, capiche?  
 
O  yes, whatever you say, MASTER  
 
 People recognize the character and react to him. The player can build a “rep.” 
People will cower at the feet of a fearsome basher or else welcome (or try and take 
advantage) of a charitable character. They will recognize him when they have 
spoken before and will remember how the player treated them the last time he 
spoke to them. Characters in the game will learn to fear and respect th e character. 
They will grovel and pander to his desires, women will adore the character and 
lavish praise upon him.  
 
Sure, you may be a fat dateless loser in real life, but in Last Rites , you get the 
women and respect you‟ve always craved.  
 
 Rumors travel fast in Sigil, and the player‟s actions (however they are interpreted) 
will herald him, and people will react appropriately.  
 “Oooooh. 
Masturbation. Now 
there’s something 
you can‟t do at 
home.”  
8:25 PM  07/12/07  Last Rites Product Review Packet  Page 11 of 47  
Last Rites Team  Version 1.5   O  a world , not A ONE -WAY STREET  
 
  There’s always somewhere to go and something to do to advance the plot.  
The adventure won‟ t grind to a halt because you can‟t solve a puzzle – just go off 
and do something else more to your liking.  
 
This theme runs through the game and carries over to scenario design and tricks 
and traps – there is always more than one way to skin a cat for every obstacle the 
player encounters, and should the player wish to leave a puzzle and come back to 
it, there will always be other avenues and adventures for them to embark on.  
 
 
 
O  a world with a pulse  
 
Other people in the world have lives. Just because t he character isn‟t there to 
observe every piece of the world doesn‟t mean that the world stops when he 
leaves the area. Every person has a daily routine and events may occur without the 
player being there to intervene or participate in them, adding to the replayability 
value. The game will have depth and be as much of a living world as we can make 
it.  
 
O  people you meet ain‟t  from m cdonald‟s  
 
People in our game have personalities – and sometimes, more than one 
personality.  The people you meet aren‟t walki ng, talking, cookie -cutter cardboard 
clichés that you‟ve seen a thousand times before, and they have wants  just like 
you. Opponents and allies don‟t break down into those two simple labels, and they 
may even switch back and forth throughout the game in response to your actions. 
You will have to deal with adversaries with multiple personalities, schizophrenia, 
or who have been possessed. It may be in the pit fiend‟s best interests to provide 
you with gifts or accurate information in order to harm one of his enemies in the 
Blood War. The friendly tavern barmaid with the flaming hair and strong sword 
arm who percolates your hormones may be a refugee from the pits of the Abyss 
taken mortal form. Your friends may be far more than they seem – they may 
change their personality depending on their allegiances and your actions. One of 
your allies won‟t take kindly you to looting bodies of the dead. Others won‟t stick 
with you except out of greed. Some smiling faces conceal fangs waiting for a 
combat when your back is a gainst the wall to turn on you.  “We were initially worried that 
a game with a severed head in it 
wouldn‟t sell. So we said, „well, 
Interplay might go for it,‟ so 
here we are.”  
8:25 PM  07/12/07  Last Rites Product Review Packet  Page 12 of 47  
Last Rites Team  Version 1.5    
On the other hand, the player can build friendships and relationships. He can build 
trust with skeptics, help out those in need, or romance those he meets. We will 
work hard to try and include positive relationships within the game – relationships 
that the player may not have in real life or may desire from watching movies. The 
player can have buddies that will lay down their life for the character, Betsies and 
Veronicas/Gingers and Mary Anns fighting over his affections, me ntors, loyal 
servants, and so on. They will thank the player for his help or fawn for his 
attention, giving the player additional ego -stroking.  
 
 
 
 
O  horns of a dilemma THAT are sharp  
 
Difficult moral choices that make you think and have consequences . Most 
fantasy RPGs have right and wrong choices, and more often than not, the morality 
is always  clear cut. You do something for the “right” reason and you get a scrap of 
information or a reward. Isn‟t that nice?  
 
It‟s predictable and stupid. In Last Rites , life (and unlife) ain‟t going to be that 
simple.  
 
There are no “right” and “wrong” courses of action – more often than not, there 
are two wrongs or two rights, and each choice will insure that someone  gets the 
short end of the stick. You may need to steal, rob corpses or kill to survive. In 
order to accomplish a greater goal, innocents may pay the price. Freeing a 
seemingly wronged prisoner from the Prison may bring a rash of serial killings 
that the Harmonium can‟t stop. Saving a little girl from a gang o f young hoods 
may be interrupting a gang initiation ritual. Giving food to a disease -ridden beggar 
from starvation may cause 20 other people to die from the plague. Not everything 
everyone says is true, and actions don‟t necessarily betray a person‟s goals. A 
“kindly” wizard has his own interests at heart and a poisoned dagger hidden in his 
sleeve. The traitor in your midst may have reasons for his actions that make 
perfect sense to you even while he has the dagger at your throat. A horsetrader 
may sell you  a mount for every bit of jink you have all the while knowing that it‟s 
likely to die on you five minutes after it goes out onto Sigil‟s pollution -encrusted 
streets. Trusting the carefully -worded argument of an angel over the blunt, fiery 
words of a hideous Pit Fiend may be the biggest mistake of your life.  “Sometimes I wonder 
why my e yeballs 
don‟t dry out.”

O  something big is going down  
 
   
  
 
You’re out to save yourself, but the ramifications of your life or unlife affect 
everything else.  Sure, you‟re just one guy, but this don‟t mean that you are a 
small fish in a big pond. You‟ll soon find that everyone wants to kill you, befriend 
you, betray you, worship you, and they all have pretty damn good reasons for 
doing so that go beyond you and your immediate wants. You are someone of 
legend, power and potential, and what you do will send earthquakes through the 
planes. It‟s all about you, you, you.  
 
O  hamlet had IT easy  
 
We got the biggest puzzle a game’s ever had: you.  No more switches, no more 
finding red/blue/yellow key, no more pressing buttons in the p roper sequence. We 
got the biggest mystery yer gonna find. To win the game, you‟ll need to find out 
who you are, who murdered  you, and why. If you don‟t, you‟ll be a slave to the 
Powers for the rest of your unlife.  
 
O  YOUR INVENTORY TALKS TO YOU  
 
Items with attitude: Items will be more than items. They will have individual 
pictures, histories, names – and by doing research, players will be able to discover 
that their weapons do more than is first apparent.  
 
Some of your weapons yodel, get jealous, and ar e even cowardly when drawn 
from their sheaths. Some require a stern talking to, others bullying, and some are 
good just to talk to when you get stuck or need a sounding board.  
 “I‟ve got your BIG

Last Rites Team  Version 1.5   O  “babes,” as in, “TRUCKLOADS OF.”  
 
 
 
Tons of Total Babes: This game will have lots of babes that make the player go 
“wow.” There will be fiendish babes, human babes, angelic babes, asian babes, 
and even undead babes. These babes will be present without nipple -age and will 
all regrettably behave within the TSR Code of Ethics.  
 
O  Pike yer jink. WHAT D‟YA KNOW , BERK?  
 
Information Driven Quests: Most of the “currency” in this particular Planescape 
game is not jink -driven. The player will discover that it‟s what he knows and what 
he chooses to tell others is the real form of barter in the world of this game. Jink is 
good for buying Arborean sweet squash, but knowing the dark of Shemska the 
Marauder‟s current plans will get the player into places that jink otherwise 
wouldn‟t.  
 
O  An interface so alive, you fear it  
 
A Living Interface: An interface that is alive with animated icons and animated 
screens. Screens that change according to how powerful you are and what you 
have equipped.  
 
O  and more babes  
 
Babes: Think babes. Then think more babes.  
 
O  IT DOESN‟T STOP WITH THE GAME  
 
Welcome to Planescape…stay for a while: Last Rites  is designed to be an 
immersive introduction to Planescape. The player and his character are dumped 
into a strange world where both of them must decipher the bizarre cultures, people 
and laws that now govern their  lives (and un -lives). The player and character 
experience the world together as the game advances, without the player having to 
force himself into a role where his character is assumed to already have a 
connection with the world and its people as many role -playing games do ( Anvil of 
Dawn , Thunderscape, Lands of Lore ). The monsters, history, locales and “I don‟t wear pants! 
Now, that’s 
entertainment.”  
8:25 PM  07/12/07  Last Rites Product Review Packet  Page 15 of 47  
Last Rites Team  Version 1.5   experiences should prove new to both the player and his character, making the 
role-playing experience that much more immersive and powerful.  
 
By the end of the game, we hope to give the player an overall feel for Planescape 
and what guides it without detailing every corner of the world. It is hoped that the 
game and the area and people it presents will serve as a foundation for future 
games and will hopefully spur a gamer to read the paper game support material 
and the novels themselves in search of more information touched upon in the 
game (especially certain factols, the Blood War, powers and areas on the Outlands 
that they heard about in passing, but did no t encounter in the game).  
 
In essence, as many aspects of the world of Planescape will be touched upon as 
possible, enough to give the feeling of a well -rounded universe, but only certain 
facets will be explored in detail. It is hoped that the touches will help set the stage 
for future games and spark player interest in both future games and TSR support 
material.

LAST RITES  
TEAM VISION STATEMENT  
 
Contained herein is the vision for the team.  
 
 
O TEAM VISION STATEMENT  
 
O  don‟t do what‟s  been done . 
 
If you’ve seen it done before, do it better than you’ve ever seen or don’t do it. 
Better yet, try to think of a way to implement it that has never been tried 
before.  
 
O  THIS is Planescape, not high fantasy  
 
This is not high fantasy. This is avant -garde fantasy. Everything you create or 
draw should reflect this.  
 
O  It‟s a spiky and jagged world…  
 
Planescape is spiky and jagged. It does not look like a soft, comfortable place to 
live. Don‟t think Ultima  towns or feudal farmsteads – think of th e jagged teeth of 
a shark or the spines of a porcupine when considering architecture.  
 
O  …filled with jagged and spiky people  
 
The people in Planescape are spiky and jagged. They don‟t look like soft 
medieval peasants.  
 
O  re-examine your first instinct  
 
If you want to create something, don’t use your first instinct . Stop for a 
moment, then put a spin on the idea. For example, don‟t draw a “sailing ship” 
as a modern day person would recognize it. Replace the sails with cobwebs, the 
8:25 PM  07/12/07  Last Rites Product Review Packet  Page 17 of 47

underwater in an air bubble, and so on.  
 
O  go nutty  
 
Go crazy. If you‟re not excited about an idea, make it exciting. Make it something 
you have to wrestle with, not just crank it out because you‟ve done it the same 
way a million times before.

This is the brutally scarred puppet that the player uses to interact with the Planescape world. This walking scab 
can‟t die, which insures hours of deathless (but not painless) gaming enjoyment. His most notable bullet points is 
his scarred, corpse -like appearance, his ability to shrug off traumatic damage and de capitation, and his inability 
to remember who or what he is.

questions about the Planescape universe, insulting other NPCs, and hitting on female zombies. He‟s 
basically a bitter, abrasive sounding board (and cluebook) for the character. He has a tendency to bite 
people he doesn‟t like.

MANAGEMENT AND  MARKETING 
REALITIES  
7/12/07 8:25:39 PM  
 
Contained herein is the host of realities of management, scheduling and marketing.  
 
 
.357 BULLET POINTS  
 
Aside from anything you want to pry out of the vision statement with a crowbar, some of 
the more obvious bullet points of this game are (in no particular order):  
 
 This is the first computer game set in TSR’s Planescape setting.  
 
 The strengths of this world are, if you need to tell anyone:  
 
 It’s hard -core adult fantasy. It use s the AD&D rules, but everything‟s got teeth, 
from the architecture, to the locals, to the monsters, to the spells. It‟s got a flavor 
all its own.  
 
 It’s a world of countless dimensions and creatures. Any other fantasy game world 
is nothing more than a drop in the ocean compared to the expanse of Planescape. 
You can go anywhere and do anything.  
 
 Interplay is the only company ever to have this license. The exclusiveness could 
be played up to reviewers and magazines.  
 
 Features.  As it stands, we‟re looking a t about 40 different creatures (a number of 
them are humans, but it might be best not to mention that), about 20 quality spells, 
and 70+ weapons and armor you can customize …this creates an almost endless 
selection of items the player can use.  
 
 Non-tileable settings.  The locations are breath -taking…hopefully, the product 
review today will convince you of the strength of this point.  
 
8:25 PM  07/12/07  Last Rites Product Review Packet  Page 32 of 47  
Last Rites Team  Version 1.5    Shadow and colored lighting effects. When the player walks into a shadowed 
area or an area of colored light, it changes the cha racter‟s look to reflect the 
lighting. A player walking through an area lit by stained glass will look like a 
humanoid rainbow as he steps through it.  
 
 Motion -capture characters.  The fluidity of the character‟s movement with be 
apparent in the first few seconds of the game.  
 
 The character is immortal and has powers that no character in any role-
playing game has ever had. You‟ve never played a character like this one. Your 
character is immortal . He can regenerate. He can lose limbs. He can talk to the 
dead. He can cut off extremities and replace them with others he finds. He‟s like a 
tougher version of Frankenstein.  
 
 Your items have personality. Some of them even talk to you. In the game, the 
player comes across new party members that sit in his inventory. Cowardly 
swords, hate -filled axes and slow -witted yodeling hammers all can have 
conversations with the player and throw in their two cents when they have 
something to say.  
 
 Your companions in the game.  The uniqueness of the companions the player can 
discover  in the game can also be played up to differentiate from other computer 
games…a smart -assed sarcastic floating skull, a teen -aged demon -girl with a 
lashing tail, a puritan succubus, a talking speak -and-spell cube, a self -exiled 
samurai, a pyromaniacal mage that is a living conduit to the elemental plane of 
fire, and a suit of living armor can all join your party.  
 
 
 
 
 “Of all the player‟s companions 
though, Morte, the floating 
skull, is the best.”

LAST RITES  
DA FUCKING PLOT  
7/12/07 8:25:39 PM  
 
“You mean I got to go all through this shit to get to the end? Fucking designers! I’d sooner die a 
thousand deaths than --” 
- Our hero, the Nameless One, finally catching on  - 
 
 
WHAT‟S THE GOAL OF THE GAME?  
 
You are a large, fleshy puzzle box with several locks. Find the keys.  
 
You wake up from the dead with amnesia.2 The point of the game is to find out where 
you are, who you are, how you died, and what the future holds in store for you. If it means 
putting a bunch of people in the dead book, so be it.  
 
At its core,  Last Rites is a mystery, with the character as the enigma. Throughout the 
game, curiosity, greed, fear, a need to escape, survival, self -defense and revenge will all 
take turns driving the character toward the grand finale, but ultimately all of these 
motivations revolve around finding the answers to the following questions:  
 
Who am I?  
 
Who keeps trying to kill me?3 
 
Why am I immortal?  
 
Learning the answers to these questions can give the player character tremendous power 
over his destiny. It may also mea n dying a lot. But fate is a fickle mistress…  
                                                           
2 Amnesia is also designed to give the player more identification with the character. The shock of Sigil and the outer planes w ould be 
diminished if the player character was assumed to know the workings  of the multiverse. The PC‟s amnesia is also used to create more 
character -driven puzzles than plot -driven (more of “who am I/was I” puzzles than “what should I do” puzzles).  
3 And why aren‟t they doing a very good job?  
8:25 PM  07/12/07  Last Rites Product Review Packet  Page 34 of 47  
Last Rites Team  Version 1.5   REINCARNATION AND AMNESIA MAKE STRANGE 
BEDFELLOWS  
 
What can you say about a game with reincarnation and amnesia as plot devices?  
 
The player quickly discovers it is almost impossible for him to die.4 He regenerates from 
traumatic damage, shrugs off stab wounds, and becomes a close friend of fast -developing 
scabs and blisters that harden and fall off within minutes.  
 
The problem is that every time the player dies, he “forgets” everything his previous 
incarnati on knew. Or thought it knew. This is extremely frustrating.5 
 
Combining the character‟s amnesia with his ability to rise from the dead, a whole bunch 
of questions come to mind. What has he done in previous incarnations that affect the 
present? What pleasant or unpleasant events have occurred in Sigil and the outer planes 
that he is responsible for? And the most important question: What led him to this state? 
How did this happen? (Many other people are also interested in this question.)  
 
As the player will d iscover, many have been touched by his actions in the past, in the 
present and the future. What the player has forgotten, they have not.  
 
 THE START: THE MORTUARY  
 
The player wakes up on a cold slab in a room piled with dead bodies. He has no memory 
of who he is or what he‟s doing there.  
 
As the player crawls off the slab, a skull6 on a nearby table introduces itself. The skull, 
Morte , calmly informs the player he‟s in the “Mortuary,” a huge morgue in the city of 
Sigil. He also mentions that if the Dustmen (the Mortuary caretakers) find out the player 
“woke up” after dying, they‟ll probably toss him in the crematorium. This would be bad.  
 
Morte will help the player escape…that is, as long as the player helps him. (The player 
cannot leave the Mortuary without Morte.) From then on, the sarcastic floating skull will 
be his near -constant smack -talkin‟ companion.  
 
                                                           
4 Another plot device. This one allows the player to regenerate while walking around, and it also allows him to explore Sigil a nd the 
outer planes with a safety net. (The net is not foolproof – cremation/disintegration, imprisonment, and the Lady of Pain are all things 
that the player still needs to watch out for.) Plotwise, it presents the player with a series of puzzles involving earlier incarnations and 
their actions.  
5 Anytime the player dies during Last Rites , however, he will not lose his memory. A previous incarnation found a means to 
temporarily prevent the amnesia to give the player a chance to find his adversary.  
6 The skull is the player‟s first “ally,”  Mortimer “Morte” Rictusgrin , a sarcastic floating skull. He floats alongside the character for 
most of the adventure, being a smart  ass and talking a lot of smack with the PC and his allies.

Last Rites Team  Version 1.5   Sigil‟S SLUMS: THE HIVE  
 
The player escapes the Mortuary and finds himself on the streets of Sigil‟s slums (the 
Hive) after dark…not a good place to be . Once outside, Morte happens to mention that 
the player comes with a handy list of “instructions” tattooed on his back.  
 
The Tattoos stitched on the character’s back tells him he has three goals:  
 
 Find someone named “Pharod” who knows something about his condition.  
 
 Find some “journal” that was supposed to be with his body (but seems to be missing).  
 
 Find out how he died/who killed him.  
 
 
   
  
 
 “Throughout the game, I 
dispense advice, abuse, and 
even hints when the player 
asks. I keep track of wh at the 
player‟s learned and what he‟s 
forgotten. I‟m a skull, a 
compass, an encyclopedia, and 
the player‟s best friend.”

Last Rites Team  Version 1.5    
 
PHAROD: RAGPICKER‟s SQUARE AND BELOW  
 
The player goes in search of “Pharod” who apparently knows someth ing about him. 
Pharod is the wheezing, asthma -ridden chief of a gang of scavengers. He has set up his 
kip in a city block that lies buried beneath a mountain of trash called “Ragpicker‟s 
Square.”  
 
The player must find Ragpicker‟s Square, dig out the entrance to Pharod‟s buried village, 
then find a way to trick/defeat Pharod‟s guards in order to meet Pharod himself.  
 
Pharod says he will help the player if the player loots one of the crypts in the Weeping 
Stone Catacombs . If the player reveals he has “forgo tten himself,” Pharod bleeds the 
player for as much money and favors as he can wring out of him.  
 
WEEPING STONE CATACOMBS  
 
The player enters the Weeping Stone Catacombs as a “favor” for Pharod. The player 
enters the catacombs beneath Sigil. Here he discovers a civilization of living dead and a 
hive of intelligent rats that exist in a shaky truce…a truce the player‟s presence could

SQUARE  
“The „square‟ was a mountain range 
of junk and cloth, mortared together 
with pigeon crap. Collectors had built 
platforms atop the mountains and 
hollowed out nests in the trash. They 
picked at the rag mountains like flies, 
buzzing to themselves when they 
came across a promising piece of 
garbage.”

the two groups, or sneak through the catacombs, get what he needs, then get out.7  
 
It turns out that the crypt that Pharod wants the player to loot is the player’s own tomb .8 If 
he can navigate the deathtraps one of his previous incarnations placed there, he can return 
the object that Pharod wants and also gain some information, weapons and clues to his 
immortality. He discovers that his attempted murderer is some asinine being called the 
Transcendent One , who seems to have been hunting the player across the span of 
several centuries.  
 
Once the player returns to Pharod with the item, Pharod (somewhat impressed) tells the 
player where his dead body was first discovered (the haunted “Alley of Lingering Sighs,” 
below).  
 
ALLEY OF LINGERING SIGHS  
 
Following Pharod’s directions, the player comes to the alley where his “corpse” was 
found. The alley happens to be alive and pregnant.  The alley has the mentality of a 
retarded child, but it can give the player some  clues about how he died. During the 
conversation, the alley happens to mention it is “ pregnant.” It is afraid that it will be 
discovered by the Harmonium (Sigil‟s cops) and be destroyed before it can give birth.  
 
Unfortunately, the player‟s recent murder has drawn a group of Harmonium guards to the 
area to investigate the killing. If the player protects (hides) the alley from the Harmonium 
(by distracting or killing them), it will have the time it needs to give birth. This birth 
results in the spontaneous generation of several new streets, lightpoles, and a portal the 
player can use to advan ce to the next scene.  
 
BROTHEL FOR SLATING INTELLECTUAL LUSTS  
 
Beyond the living alley the player enters Sigil’s upper class district -- and stumbles 
across a brothel that caters to customers who seek anything but sexual gratification. 
While in the Clerk‟s Ward,  the player comes across a brothel that caters to those seeking 
intellectual gratification. If the player survives all the intellectual challenges posed by the 
attractive ladies in this house of verbal ill repute, he can ask the hostess, a beautiful 
succubus named Fall-From -Grace , to join his party.  
                                                           
7 The player‟s actions here may cause problems later…the player has to return to these catacombs later on in the adventure and must 
deal with the residents again.  
8 One of the player‟s previous incarnations had the tomb built to as a trap for his killer (and failing that, at least try and throw his 
killer off the scent). It didn‟t work.

SIEGE TOWER: THE STEEL TIERS  
 
A battered siege tower sitting in the middle of Sigil’s upper class ward hides an 
exclusive weapons shop. “The Steel Tiers” is  a huge siege tower that lies in the Market 
Ward. It is actually a weapons shop run by an iron golem whose only purpose is to create 
and enhance weaponry. The player may buy strange weapons from him, identify weapons, 
or ask him to enhance weapons they already possess.  
 
The purpose of this area  is to allow players to customize their own weapons and armor. 
They can modify weapons they like to use and give the weapons abilities more suited to 
their style of play.  
 
 THE STEEL TIERS  I protect entropy’s righ t to exist,  
the golem intoned, its metallic voice 
ringing like steel in the hollows of the 
battered siege tower. If necessary, I 
shall breach the walls of creation to 
free Chaos from the chains of 
Order.  
 
The tower itself was a magnificent 
mosaic of corrosive burns, rends, and 
torn metal, scars of countless wars 
across countless dimensions. I pitied 
all that had tried to stand against it 
and hoped that I would never be 
counted among their number.

THE BLACK -BARBED MAZE  
 
From the upper class ward, the player finds a portal to a Black -Barbed Maze 
inhabited by a lusty old crone who resembles a plump, asthmatic Weez Dugan. After 
his experiences at the brothel and other sections of Sigil‟s upper class district, the player 
transports to the Black -Barbed Maze, a maze composed of twis ted black trees. The maze 
holds a single resident: a hideous old crone, Ravel, who is rumored to know something of 
his past and his future. The player must track down Ravel and pry the information from 
the crone while fending off her lecherous advances.  
 
Ravel informs the player that he is immortal because his mortality was split from him (as 
a matter of fact, Ravel is the one who performed the ritual in the first place). She claims 
that his mortality is imprisoned and recommends the player go to the priso n-city of Curst 
to look for it.  
 
Ravel cannot remember why the player and his mortality were split. She claims there was 
some reason for it, but she can‟t recall what it was.  
 
 “Serrated black growths g rew from the walls of the maze and tore at our clothes 
as we passed. The blackened branches that wove the floor and walls of the 
maze seemed to shift slightly out of the corner of our eye, and we took care not 
to linger within the shadows of the roots for too long.”

PRISON GATE -TOWN OF CURST  
 
Welcome to the prison town of Curst. Once inside the gates, you’re an inmate. The 
player arrives in Curst in search of information. While there, he becomes acquainted with 
the gang of criminals, politicians and backstabbers that live there. In the depths of the 
Curst jail, he discovers Trias the Condemn ed, a deva9 who has been imprisoned by the 
Curst officials. If the player frees him, Trias tells the player there is a fiend on the 
Outlands that could help the player reach Baator (Forked -Tounge, below).  
 
While the player is gone from Curst, Trias (who is really quite a bastard past his angelic 
aura) proceeds to cause all sorts of trouble that results in the town sliding off its plane of 
existence. When the player returns to Curst, the city will be gone.

FORKED -TOUNGE‟S CRATER  
 
With help from Trias,  the player comes to the home of a charitable fiend. The player 
comes to the home of Forked -Tounge, a Baatezu10 hermit that lives in a huge blasted 
crater on the Outlands. Many centuries ago, Trias suckered Forked -Tounge into signing a 
contract that would force him to tell the truth and perform acts of charity for the rest of 
his life. This contract was such a death sentence to the hate -filled fiend that he left Baator 
and set up his kip on the Outlands.  
 
Forked -Tounge (gritting his teeth as he gives somethi ng for nothing) provides the 
character with the location of a portal and a portal key that will take him to the Pillar of 
Skulls, a location that should finally be able to answer all the questions the player has 
about his condition.

Last Rites Team  Version 1.5   are now embedded in a huge pillar and forced to tell the truth to all who petition them for 
answers. There, after much bantering and threats with the skulls that swarm on the pillar, 
the player learns:  
 
 The location of his imprisoned mortality.  It lies on the Negative Material Plane (a 
plane composed of the malignant energy that animates undead creatures) in an 
impenetrable floating structure called the Fortress of Regrets.  
 
 The name and location of his “murderer,” the  Transcendent One . The pillar tells 
the player the Transcendent One can be found at the Fortress of Regrets.  
 
 Everytime the player dies, he “casts a shadow on existence.”  The Pillar chuckles 
and says that every time the player is “killed,” someone else in the multiverse dies in 
the character‟s place. This victim becomes a vengeful shadow that is banished to the 
Fortress of Regrets.  
 
 A subtle, sarcastic warning of what awaits the player at the end of his journey.  
 
 The name of the person who can tell the player  where the portal to the Fortress 
of Regrets and the key to open the portal: Trias, the deva who sent the player to 
the pillar in the first place.  The pillar tells the player Trias lied to him on purpose – 
the player will have to find out why on his own.  
 
After some trouble with the fiendish locals, the player escapes the plane and travels back 
to Curst.  
 
CARCERI: THE BANISHED TOWN  
 
The player arrives back at the prison town of Curst…except it’s not there anymore.  
After the player freed Trias and left the t own to go to the Pillar of Skulls, Trias caused the 
entire town to “slide” into another plane (the prison plane of Carceri). The player is 
forced to travel through a portal the town slid through and try and rescue it from its fate. 
There, the player must:  
 
 Track town the missing city of Curst in the harsh environment of Carceri.  
 
 Protect Curst from Carceri‟s evil natives who are very happy for the fresh meat.  
 
 Rescue the town by bringing it back to its proper plane. This will involve killing the 
betrayers t hat started this whole sliding mess in the first place.11 
 
While on this plane, the player tracks down Trias and learns the last bits of information to 
complete the quest: the nature of the key needed to get to the final location of the game 
                                                           
11 The player must cause the banished town to slide back for his own sake…he cannot find any other portal on the plane that will  take 
him back within the game.  
8:25 PM  07/12/07  Last Rites Product Review Packet  Page 44 of 47  
Last Rites Team  Version 1.5   (The Fortress of Regrets ) and the location of the portal to the Fortress (the portal is 
located in a small niche in the Mortuary).12 Trias will use the information as leverage 
against the player character to try and save his life.  
 
An awesome movie plays that shows the to wn sliding back into its proper plane, the 
player, his arms outstretched as the wave of portal energy washes over him and the town 
(think of Soren as he summons the Nexus in Star Trek: Generations) . 
 
Once Curst is back on the Outlands, the player travels back to Sigil and return to the 
Mortuary.  
 
GRAND FINALE: FORTRESS OF REGRETS  
 
The adventure comes full circle. The player returns to where he started the adventure: the 
Mortuary. Now that he has the key, and player uses one of the Mortuary portals to travel  
to the Fortress of Regrets . There, the player must:  
 
 Battle:  Defeat the horde of vengeful shadows that lurk in the halls of the Fortress.  
 
 Puzzles:  Survive three trials (impulse, illusion and spiritual illumination).  
 
 Final Battle:  The player confronts his adversary, the Transcendent One, and 
discovers the truth: his “adversary” is actually his missing mortality that has evolved 
into its own personality. The Transcendent One‟s personality depends on the 
character‟s actions over the course of Last Rites .13  
 
Once the player learns the truth, he can:  
 
 (“Bad” Ending) Walk away and don’t look back. The player does not have to 
become mortal again if he doesn‟t want to (immortality, even with amnesia, has its 
obvious benefits). The tone of this ending will leave something to be desired, but the 
player may choose it if they wish. If the player chooses this ending, the game basically 
begins again where it started, with the player awakening in the Mortuary without his 
memory and a (saddened) Morte greeting him back to  life again.  
 
 (“Not Quite so Good” Ending) Perform “Last Rites,” damning yourself but 
saving all of existence by becoming mortal and letting death take its natural 
course.  If the player can convince  his mortality to return to him (his mortality has no 
desire to return to him – it doesn‟t like the player and enjoys its autonomy), the player 
discovers why his mortality was separated from him in the first place…to avoid the 
penance for a lifetime of evil.  
 
                                                           
12 The irony is that this is about five feet from where the player started the game.  
13 Basically, if the player was an evil asshole, his adversary is supremely good and self -righteous. If the player acted li ke a goody two -
shoes for the entire adventure, his adversary oozes with evil. If the player was neutral, his adversary is indifferent to his  fate. 
8:25 PM  07/12/07  Last Rites Product Review Packet  Page 45 of 47  
Last Rites Team  Version 1.5    
 (Best Ending) This is a game. I want to have my cake and eat it, too. The player 
learns why his mortality was separated from him, but rather than becoming mortal, he 
turns on it, kill ing it/trapping it and preventing it from interfering with his life 
anymore (i.e., killing him). He then wanders the planes as a happy immortal.

“Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Gameplay…”  
- The five elements  - 
 
 
THIS GAME DIFFERS FROM „NORMAL‟ AD&D  
 
Last Rites takes some rule detours to breathe new life into the AD&D system for 
experienced players and make it accessible for new players.  
 
Some aspects of AD&D are intriguing…other portions have been done to death or bore 
players to tears. Fortunately, the world of Planescape allows us to take the AD&D rules 
system and play around with them, emphasizing some of the lesser known aspects of the 
system and customizing others.  
 
O  YOUR ACTIONS  DEFINE YOUR CHARACTER  
 
Your actions  in the game are the character creation process.  
 
The player is not locked into any one class right at the start. Rather than being 
stamped with a label at the beginning (fighter, mage, thief, priest), your actions in 
the game define your character.  
 
In his past thousand or more incarnations, the player character has followed every 
career path a player character can follow and maxed out all his characteristics. It‟s 
just a matter of remembering it all. As the adventure progresses and he regains his 
memories (or meets teachers), he will remember  skills, powers and regain 
characteristics related to all the classes he was once a member of. This allows us 
to give fringe benefits, perks, and special p owers outside of the AD&D normal 
advancement scheme.  
 
8:25 PM  07/12/07  Last Rites Product Review Packet  Page 47 of 47  
Last Rites Team  Version 1.5   O  POWERS NO AD&D CHARACTER HAS EVER 
HAD 
 
The player starts out with powers no AD&D player character has ever had.  
 
He‟s immortal. He‟s got magical immunities. He can speak with the dead. He can 
regenerate. He can re -attach severed limbs. Despite his appearance, he has a raw, 
unbridled animal magnetism that makes women swoon.  
 
O  YOU DON‟T START OUT AT 1st LEVEL  
 
The player spends the adventure remembering his true abilities.  
 
The player starts out a s a blank slate (the equivalent of a third level character) 
with tons of fringe benefits (mentioned above) and lots of hit points.  
 
The player has been 25th level in all possible AD&D character classes in his 
previous incarnations. He can remember abilities that pertain to all these classes 
over the course of the adventure. He has the ability to cast spells beyond his 
current level (such as Wish spells), use warrior proficiencies normally available 
only at much higher levels and get various priest and thie f benefits much earlier 
than normally allowed."
