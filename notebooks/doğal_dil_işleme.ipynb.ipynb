      "Core Game play  \n",
      " The core game play in “Silent Hill 2” will be a mix  of both fighting “monsters” and solving \n",
      "puzzles, both of which serve your progress in the g ame. \n",
      " Fighting – The fighting in “Silent Hill 2” will be  based much around its survival horror \n",
      "counterpart “Resident Evil”. What will set the comb at apart from our counterparts is the overall \n",
      "style and pace of the game. Unlike the previous gam e and much of the “Resident Evil” series, \n",
      "players will be more inclined to avoid battles enti rely because of the disturbing nature of their \n",
      "design and sound. A slew of enemies will be roaming  the streets, including back alleys and \n",
      "hidden under cars. When it comes to interior explor ation, enemies will be dotted around \n",
      "corridors and rooms, but sparsely enough to maintai n the feeling of isolation and fear. The \n",
      "game works heavily on the concept that what you don ’t see, makes you increasingly scared. An \n",
      "example of this would be to have a long dark corrid or with nothing but doors to explore. The \n",
      "player cannot see to the other end of the corridor,  creating the fear that something is at the \n",
      "end of the corridor, making the player move apprehe nsively to the other end. A possible way to \n",
      "describe the combat in “Silent Hill 2” is to compar e it to other survival horror games. For \n",
      "example,  in survival games such as Resident Evil, you will walk down a corridor with a sick \n",
      "feeling in your stomach, and then all of a sudden a  dog will jump out and attack you. You can \n",
      "kill the dog and end the threat until more enemies come along, usually a horde of zombies. \n",
      " In Silent Hill, you will walk down a corridor with  a sick feeling in your stomach, and \n",
      "nothing will happen, the threat doesn’t start and i t never ends. Killing one nurse in a somewhat \n",
      "abandoned hospital is not enough to know you’re saf e. The fixed camera angles that were a \n",
      "core characteristic of the first game will return, to help intensify this feeling of isolation and \n",
      "apprehension. The two main ways of detecting these monsters will be a flashlight for visual \n",
      "detection, and a radio that emits static when a mon ster is nearby. Both these methods allow \n",
      "the player to be warned of danger, but the sensory perception of the monsters mean that \n",
      "danger is most certainly on its way. Incidentally, if James leaves his flashlight off in dark areas, \n",
      "the screen will increasingly gain brightness, imita ting the effect that his eyes are getting used to \n",
      "the dark.  \n",
      " Puzzles – The Puzzles in “Silent Hill 2” will trul y attempt to break usual puzzle solving \n",
      "conventions in the genre. Opposed to the usual puzz le solving which would remove you from \n",

      " the immersion of the world, the intention here is t o incorporate the necessary “pieces of the \n",
      "puzzle” into the narrative. Instead of the cliché “ there is a hole here for a crest, go and find it”. \n",
      "The style of the puzzles in “Silent Hill 2” will de fiantly reflect the atmosphere and underlying \n",
      "narrative of the game. The audience is promoted to think hard about the solutions, giving the \n",
      "players neither the task of collection, nor the tac tic of try every combination. This method was \n",
      "incorporated in the first Silent Hill at heart. The  puzzles could be cracked via trial and error, but \n",
      "the iconography surrounding the puzzle made it incr easingly disturbing. \n",
      "Game Flow  \n",
      " Typical game flow in “Silent Hill 2” will be norma lly quite linear. Players will be given a \n",
      "portion of the narrative, then be given a reason in  that narrative to explore a certain section of \n",
      "the town, which will be usually an indoor section ( levels). On entering the section, they will \n",

      "between the usual game flow conventions will be spe cial “set pieces”, which will act as a buffer \n",
